# React-Books

Welcome to my Udacity RND project 1: Book Tracking App.

This app allows the user to categorize books into three lists, Already Read, Currently Reading, and Want To Ready. The user can
search a database of books and add them to their shelf. It uses react.js to manage state and update the dom. 

Required:

Node.js
React.js and related libs.


To run this app on a developement server.

1. Clone the repo into a folder
2. Run NPM install to get all the required libraries
3. Run NPM start to run the node.js developement server.
3. A browser window will open at localhost:3000

Thank you.
